## Summary

A One Piece themed trivia game where the player starts the trivia game and is given a time limit of 10 seconds to answer each question. At the end of the game a result screen will show your score and a restart button will appear so you can try again if you want to. Great practice of newly learned jQuery timed events using intervals and timeouts.
